      <h1>Welcome to Eight Thirty Nine</h1>
      <p>Hey!</p>
      <p>I'm Chuck Greenman and I write software.  At some point I got tired of trying to think of a creative domain name, that time just happened to be 8:39 pm.  I'm mainly interested in writing ruby on rails, C++ and MATLab code.  I've got a little bit of experience in Javascript and SQL as well.  Check out some of my projects:</p>

    <p><strong>Resolute (Work In Progess / Active): </strong>We all make resolutions, but who can ever keep track of them?  Resolute helps you manage your commitments.  Resolute allows you to make your resolutions public or private and view other people's public resolutions. <a href="http://github.com/chuckgreenman/resolute">Check it out on GitHub</a></p></li>
    <p><strong>Sprints (Work In Progress / Delayed): </strong>It's hard to get stuff done if you don't plan.  Sprints keeps track of your todo list and has a built in pomodoro timer.  With powerful support for teams, it will be a hit at the office.  Be your most productive all day long with sprints. Security condiserations prevent this GitHub repository from being public.

    <p><strong>Note </strong>Please stop talking about the block chain.  If you don't know what the block chain is, don't tout the benifits of the block chain, don't write articles about it, don't tell me it's going to make everything else obselete. Thanks: Chuck</p>
