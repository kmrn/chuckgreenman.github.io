    <h1>Welcome to Eight Thirty Nine</h1>
    <p>Howdy!</p>
    <p>I'm Chuck Greenman and I write software.  At some point I got tired of trying to think of a creative domain name, that time just happened to be 8:39 pm.  I'm mainly interested in writing ruby on rails, C++ and MATLab code.  I've got a little bit of experience in Javascript and SQL as well.  Check out some of my projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resolute (Work In Progess): </strong>We all make resolutions, but who can ever keep track of them?  Resolute helps you manage your commitments.  Resolute allows you to make your resolutions public or private and view other people's public resolutions.</li>
    </ul>
